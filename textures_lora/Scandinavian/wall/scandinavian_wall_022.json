"prompt": "The image showcases an interior space designed in a modern, Scandinavian style. The focal point of the room is a large wall painted in a muted grey tone, which serves as a canvas for several black and white photographs featuring a diverse range of subjects. These photographs are scattered across the upper portion of the wall, each framed within square and rectangular forms that vary in size.\n\nThe floor beneath is adorned with a light-colored, textured rug that adds warmth to the space. The furniture arrangement includes a plush gray sofa upholstered in velvet, accompanied by two additional seating options: one with a patterned throw and another that sports a geometric design. Both pieces are positioned to face each other, creating an inviting conversation area.\n\nA white pendant light hangs from the ceiling, casting a soft glow over the room. Adjacent to the wall, a shelving unit is stocked with various decorative items such as potted plants, vases, and sculptures, which contribute to the room's overall aesthetic of simplicity and sophistication.\n\nOn the right side of the image, there is a small dining table paired with chairs, offering additional seating or workspace area. The walls are painted in light blue tones that complement the grey of the sofa, and a large window allows natural light to flood into the room.\n\nThe overall visual aesthetic of the room is one of comfort and minimalist elegance, with an emphasis on clean lines and soft textures. This space exudes a sense of calm and tranquility, making it an ideal setting for relaxation or quiet reflection.",
