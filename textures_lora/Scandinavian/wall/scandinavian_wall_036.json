"prompt": "The image depicts a bedroom interior with a strong emphasis on modern Scandinavian design. The walls are adorned with a large, vibrant yellow textured wallpaper featuring abstract shapes and lines that resemble a dynamic, flowing, or possibly organic pattern. This bold choice of color gives the room a lively and energetic atmosphere, while the patterns provide a sense of motion and creativity.\n\nThe bed, covered in a light-colored comforter, is flanked by two pillows with geometric designs, contributing to the contemporary aesthetic of the space. The flooring appears to be minimalistic, with a grey hue that complements the yellow wallpaper without overpowering it. \n\nTo the right of the bed, there's a nightstand with what looks like a lamp on top, enhancing the room's functionality and coziness. Overall, the room has a clean and modern look, with the bold yellow wallpaper serving as a striking focal point that anchors the design of the space.",
