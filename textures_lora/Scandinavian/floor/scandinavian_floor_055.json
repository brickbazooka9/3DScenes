"prompt": "The image captures a serene living room that exudes a Scandinavian aesthetic, characterized by its natural light and minimalist design. The heart of the space is a wooden deck that seamlessly transitions into an interior living room through large glass doors. This open connection between indoor and outdoor spaces is a hallmark of Nordic design, which often emphasizes the integration of the built environment with nature.\n\nThe floor texture appears to be a light-colored, possibly light oak or ash wood, which complements the natural surroundings seen through the windows. The wooden deck features a single ceiling fan, a classic detail that is both functional and stylish in this context.\n\nOn the left side of the image, there's a potted plant with broad green leaves, adding a touch of greenery to the space and contrasting nicely with the neutral tones of the room. A small wooden coffee table sits in front of the sofa, which is adorned with plush cushions and a patterned throw blanket, inviting relaxation and conversation.\n\nThe overall visual aesthetic is one of tranquility and modern simplicity, with clean lines and uncluttered spaces that are both visually appealing and comforting.",
