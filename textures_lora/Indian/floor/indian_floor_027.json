"prompt": "The image displays a large, shiny tiled floor that gives off an Indian-style aesthetic, featuring a pattern of rectangular tiles. The material appears to be high-quality marble or a similar type of polished stone. The color is light with veins of darker hues, which is typical for natural marble. The cultural origin suggests this might be a design choice inspired by traditional Indian architecture or a similar motif from the subcontinent.\n\nThe pattern consists of rectangular tiles arranged in an orderly manner, and there are no distinct designs or motifs visible on the floor. The overall visual aesthetic is one of elegance and luxury, with the shiny surface reflecting light around the room, enhancing its grandeur.",
