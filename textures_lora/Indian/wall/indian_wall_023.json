"prompt": "The image showcases a modern living room with an Indian-style marble wall texture serving as the focal point of the space. The texture is characterized by a combination of geometric shapes, such as triangles and rectangles, that are interspersed within a larger wave-like pattern. This gives the wall a dynamic yet cohesive design. The color palette includes various shades of brown, beige, and black, reflecting a warm and earthy aesthetic, which is typical of marble designs.\n\nThe living room itself is furnished with a modern couch adorned with blue cushions, complementing the neutral tones of the wall texture. A wooden side table is placed next to the couch, adding a touch of rustic charm. The floor is covered by a dark area rug that contrasts with the lighter tones of the furniture and walls.\n\nIn terms of cultural origin, the marble wall texture is reminiscent of traditional Indian craftsmanship, particularly the designs found on ancient temple walls and intricate artwork. This fusion of modern design elements with traditional Indian aesthetics creates a unique visual appeal that is both contemporary and timeless.\n\nThe overall visual aesthetic of the image is one of sophistication and harmony, where each element in the room has been thoughtfully chosen to create a balanced and inviting living space. The image captures not just a room, but a slice of life that embodies modern style with a nod to tradition, all under one beautiful roof.",
