"prompt": "The image shows a wall with a textured surface that appears to mimic the aesthetic of Japanese paper screens, known as fusuma. This is evident from the repetitive pattern and the naturalistic elements within it, such as the depiction of what could be bamboo or other plant life. The color palette consists of earthy tones with a gradient of greens and browns that gives depth to the texture. The wall is mounted on a purple background which contrasts with the warm colors of the wall decoration. To the right, there's a glimpse of a modern interior space with a white ceiling, a light fixture, a plant, a small piece of artwork, a vase with flowers, and a cup on a table. The overall visual aesthetic is contemporary with an influence of traditional Japanese art.",
