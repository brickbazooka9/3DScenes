The wooden planks are arranged with precision and uniformity, creating an intricate lattice effect. The color palette is dominated by natural tones, ranging from light to dark brown hues, which gives the structure a warm and rustic feel.\n\nThis wall texture could be inspired by traditional Japanese shoji screens, which are typically made of thin wooden slats set into a frame with a lattice design.
