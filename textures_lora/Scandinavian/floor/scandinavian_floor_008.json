"prompt": " This image showcases a modern interior space featuring a Scandinavian style floor texture. The floor is covered in large, rectangular planks with a light wood finish, giving off a warm and contemporary vibe. The pattern on the wood creates a geometric and somewhat herringbone design.\n\nThe room itself has a minimalist aesthetic, with white walls that complement the wooden floor. A marble fireplace serves as the focal point of the room, adding an element of luxury and sophistication. Surrounding the fireplace is a variety of seating options, including chairs and a couch, arranged for comfortable conversation or viewing of the television visible in the background.\n\nThe overall visual aesthetic is one of clean lines, neutral color palettes, and an emphasis on functionality and style. The room appears to be well-lit, suggesting it may have large windows not visible in the image. The space seems to be both stylish and functional, indicative of Scandinavian design, which often balances form with practicality. ",
