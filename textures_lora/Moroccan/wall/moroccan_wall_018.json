"prompt": "The image features a room decorated in a Moroccan style. Dominating the scene is a large textured wall, which has a geometric pattern that resembles traditional Moroccan zellige tilework. This type of wall decoration is often found in North African architecture and is characterized by its intricate diamond-shaped patterns. The color palette includes whites, browns, and greys, giving the room a neutral yet textured feel. \n\nThe room itself has a soft, bohemian vibe. A beige rug with fringe adorns the floor, lending warmth to the space. On top of it, there's a small table set up for what appears to be a reading or relaxation area. Two plush pillows, one gray and one green, add a touch of color and comfort to the scene. \n\nHanging from the center of the wall are three spherical light fixtures, each with a different finish—silver, gold, and copper—adding a metallic accent to the room. The combination of these elements creates a space that seems both cozy and stylish, reflecting traditional Moroccan design principles with a modern twist. \n\n**One line prompt:** \"Describe the decorative elements and overall aesthetic of this room in terms of Moroccan style wall texture.\"",
