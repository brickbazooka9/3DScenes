"prompt": "The image depicts an interior scene of a bright, airy kitchen and dining area during daylight, likely influenced by Scandinavian design aesthetics. The kitchen features clean lines, white cabinets with silver handles, and modern appliances including a refrigerator, oven, and dishwasher. There's a light wooden countertop that contrasts with the white cabinets. A kitchen island with an open shelf displaying cookbooks is visible in the center of the kitchen. The dining area includes a wooden table surrounded by a set of four chairs with woven seats. Above the island, a black and white chevron patterned rug adds a touch of visual interest to the space. On the walls, there are framed photos or artwork, contributing to the cozy, lived-in feel of the room. Natural light enters through large windows, highlighting the cleanliness and the neutral color palette dominated by white, gray, and black tones. The overall visual aesthetic is one of modern minimalism with a touch of warmth brought in by natural materials like wood and the use of a patterned rug.",
