"prompt": "The image displays an Indian-style wall texture characterized by a warm, earthy color palette featuring reds, browns, and beiges. This textured wall serves as a rich backdrop for the contemporary furnishings in the room. A white couch is positioned against the wall, with a single multicolored throw pillow adding a pop of color to the scene. Above the couch hang two picture frames, one containing what appears to be a landscape and the other holding three abstract art pieces.\n\nThe overall visual aesthetic combines elements of traditional Indian interior design with modern furnishings, creating a fusion that reflects cultural heritage while maintaining contemporary style. The texture itself seems to be made from natural materials, likely plaster or cement, with visible layers and a rustic finish, giving it an organic look.",
