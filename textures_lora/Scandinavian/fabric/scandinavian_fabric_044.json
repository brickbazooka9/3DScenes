"prompt": "The image shows a wall hanging with a vibrant and stylized floral pattern in shades of blue, teal, green, and yellow. The design includes abstract tree silhouettes and foliage motifs on a dark background, creating a lush and organic feel. The textile appears to be a curtain with a flowing, semi-transparent fabric that suggests lightness and movement.\n\nIn front of the curtains, on a small black table or stand, is a reading lamp with a white shade, casting a warm glow over a wooden plant stand holding a potted indoor plant. The books on the stand seem to be related to nature or outdoor activities, given their outdoory appearance. There's also a small green plant perched atop one of the books.\n\nThe overall visual aesthetic is cozy and inviting, with a hint of natural elements that contribute to an atmosphere of serenity and comfort. It has a touch of bohemian style, possibly indicative of a relaxed, creative living space. The pattern, textures, and objects within the image reflect a blend of minimalist design with a love for nature and outdoor themes.",
