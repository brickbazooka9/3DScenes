"prompt": "The image depicts an interior space designed with a Moroccan influence. The dominant pattern is characterized by intricate geometric shapes and patterns that are often associated with traditional Moroccan designs, predominantly in shades of blue and white. This motif is prevalent throughout the room, from the rugs to the decorative items.\n\nThe walls feature a textured material that gives an impression of a stucco-like finish, which is consistent with Moroccan architectural styles. The ceiling also incorporates this texture, creating a cohesive and culturally rich aesthetic.\n\nThe flooring consists of large, patterned tiles in a blend of blues, whites, and subtle tones that complement the wall decor. The seating area includes two couches with white upholstery and throw pillows displaying the same geometric patterns as seen on the walls.\n\nIn the center of the room is a coffee table with a glass top, reflecting the light and adding to the room's elegance. Above the sofa, a large circular mirror hangs, enhancing the sense of space in the room. The lighting fixtures are designed with a modern twist, featuring metallic finishes and geometric shapes that echo the room's overall design theme.\n\nThe overall visual aesthetic is one of luxury and cultural fusion, where traditional Moroccan elements meet contemporary interior design. It exudes warmth and comfort while maintaining a stylish and sophisticated vibe.",
