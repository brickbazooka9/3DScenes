"prompt": "The image displays an interior space designed with modern Scandinavian aesthetics. At the center of the composition is a dining area featuring a light-toned wooden table surrounded by six chairs, each unique in design but consistent in material, suggesting a contemporary and minimalist approach to furniture. The chairs are positioned around the table in a symmetrical arrangement, indicative of functionality and visual balance.\n\nAbove the table, a chandelier with several spherical elements serves as a striking centerpiece, contributing to the overall brightness and airy atmosphere of the room. The ceiling is adorned with wooden beams and pendant lights that hang from them, further enhancing the warm and welcoming ambiance.\n\nThe walls are decorated with large, textured curtains that add depth and softness to the space. A variety of indoor plants are scattered throughout the room, bringing a touch of nature indoors and complementing the natural materials used in the furniture. The greenery adds vibrancy to the otherwise neutral color palette, which is dominated by wood tones, creams, and soft grays.\n\nOn the right side of the image, a large mirror reflects the interior design, adding an element of depth and dimension. On the left side, a wooden console table holds various decorative items, including vases and a framed picture, providing a personal touch to the space. The overall visual aesthetic is one of clean lines, natural materials, and a sense of openness and modern style.",
