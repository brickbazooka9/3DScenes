"prompt": "The image depicts an interior living space that exudes a Scandinavian style aesthetic, characterized by clean lines, minimalist decor, and natural light. The room is spacious, with high ceilings and large windows allowing for ample natural light to fill the space.\n\nThe flooring appears to be a light-colored hardwood, which complements the furniture. On the left side of the image, there's a modern-looking sofa with two plush cushions. The couch is adorned with several decorative pillows, and in front of it, a wooden coffee table holds a few items.\n\nAgainst one wall, a large white pendant light hangs from the ceiling, providing additional illumination to the room. Adjacent to the sofa, there's a wooden ladder leaning against the wall, suggesting that this space is used for multiple functions beyond seating.\n\nA beige area rug sits on the floor next to the sofa, adding texture and warmth to the otherwise neutral color palette. On the right side of the room, there's a wooden console table holding decorative items such as a vase and books. Above the console table, a large window allows sunlight to stream in.\n\nA white curtain is drawn back from the window, revealing lush greenery outside, which brings a touch of nature into the living room. The overall visual aesthetic of the room is clean, modern, and inviting, with careful attention to detail and an emphasis on natural materials and light colors.",
