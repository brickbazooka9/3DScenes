"prompt": "The image showcases a beautifully decorated living room that exudes an Indian style aesthetic. Dominating the room is a wooden coffee table, adorned with a variety of patterned cushions and a vibrant throw blanket in shades of red and gold. Suspended above it are hanging lights that add a warm glow to the space.\n\nThe living room features a white sofa upholstered in a textured fabric, providing a stark contrast to the wooden elements. Above the sofa hangs an abstract painting, its colors reflecting the traditional color palette of Indian art.\n\nTo the left, a large window allows natural light to fill the room, while on the right, a swinging chair with intricate wood carvings invites relaxation. The floor is covered in a plush area rug that complements the overall color scheme of the room.\n\nThe walls are painted in a soft beige, but it's the use of maroon accents that truly tie the room together. This richly detailed space has been designed with comfort and style in mind, evoking a sense of traditional Indian interior design.",
