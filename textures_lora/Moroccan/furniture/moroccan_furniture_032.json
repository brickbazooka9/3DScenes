The tiles are predominantly blue and white, reflecting the traditional Moroccan color palette, and they cover both the floor and the walls, creating a harmonious visual experience.\n\nThe patio is well-maintained, with a red carpet that leads to a potted plant in the center. This plant serves as a focal point, providing a touch of natural greenery amidst the man-made structures. The furniture visible includes a bench and chairs, all upholstered in the traditional Moroccan style.\n\nThe floor is adorned with geometric patterns, further enhancing the cultural origin of the space. These patterns are common in Moroccan architecture, where they often serve decorative purposes as well as functional ones, such as creating illusions of space or providing slip-resistant surfaces for pedestrians.\n\nIn the background, there is a red archway, adding another layer of color and architectural detail to the scene. The overall visual aesthetic is one of tranquility and cultural richness, inviting viewers to imagine themselves sitting in this cozy patio, perhaps enjoying a cup of mint tea and soaking up the atmosphere.
