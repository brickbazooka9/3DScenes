"prompt": "The image features a room that emulates a Scandinavian style, characterized by clean lines, neutral color palettes, and a mix of materials that suggest warmth and simplicity. The wall texture appears to be reminiscent of a traditional Scandinavian wooden paneling often seen in older homes or cabins, but with a contemporary twist that might incorporate other materials such as wood, concrete, or even metal. The pattern is irregular and has a rustic, hand-crafted feel to it, contributing to the room's natural aesthetic.\n\nThe overall visual aesthetic of the room is modern yet cozy, with elements of both minimalist design and lived-in comfort. The choice of furnishings and decor reflects a casual, unpretentious lifestyle, while still maintaining an air of elegance. Natural light from the windows enhances the openness of the space, making it appear more inviting.\n\nThe room is well-appointed with furniture that includes a bookshelf filled with books, a white sofa, and a dining table. The presence of plants brings a touch of greenery into the living area.",
