"prompt": "The image depicts a modern, minimalist interior space that exudes a Scandinavian design aesthetic. Dominating the room is a large, L-shaped sofa with a simple yet elegant design, accompanied by a side table and two armchairs, all in neutral shades that lend to the overall calm and serene vibe of the space. The flooring features light wood planks, adding warmth to the otherwise cool color palette.\n\nA white archway leads to another room, suggesting an open-concept layout. The walls are painted in a crisp white, which enhances the sense of space and brightness. Large windows allow ample natural light into the room, further emphasizing the airy feel. Decorative elements include framed wall art that adds a touch of personality to the otherwise clean lines, as well as a couple of potted plants that introduce a hint of nature indoors.\n\nOverall, the visual aesthetic is one of understated elegance and functional simplicity, with an emphasis on natural materials, clean lines, and a limited color palette. The furniture and decor items are chosen for their modern design and practical function, rather than excessive embellishment. The room's Scandinavian style is characterized by its focus on functionality, comfort, and the use of neutral colors to create a serene atmosphere.",
