"prompt": "The image showcases a living room adorned with a vibrant green wall that features a distinctive cracked marble pattern. The wall's texture is reminiscent of traditional Japanese tansu-gane, a form of Japanese interior design known for its intricate and detailed woodwork. This particular style of wall texture is made to mimic the appearance of marble, with veins and cracks that add depth and sophistication to the space.\n\nIn front of this striking wall, there's a purple sofa inviting relaxation, accompanied by two matching ottomans, one in each corner, providing additional seating or footrests. A beige armchair is positioned against the wall, offering another comfortable spot for leisure. A floor lamp with an elegant design and a traditional Japanese-style lantern add to the room's cozy ambiance, while a modern coffee table sits in the middle of the seating arrangement, ready to hold cups of tea or other beverages and snacks during gatherings or quiet moments of solitude.\n\nThe overall visual aesthetic is one of elegance and comfort, with a hint of cultural richness through the use of traditional Japanese design elements. The room seems designed for socializing or unwinding, and the choice of bold, contrasting colors adds to its vibrant and inviting atmosphere.",
