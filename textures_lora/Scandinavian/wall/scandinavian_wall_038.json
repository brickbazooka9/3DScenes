This texture is complemented by the minimalist interior design, which features a neutral color palette dominated by beige tones.\n\nThe room's material composition includes white walls that provide a clean backdrop for the abstract wall art, contributing to the open and spacious feel of the room. The ceiling is painted in a lighter shade, subtly contrasting with the wall texture and enhancing the overall visual aesthetic.\n\nThe flooring consists of light-colored hardwood planks that add warmth and natural texture to the space. A large area rug in a soft beige color is placed centrally on the floor, anchoring the seating arrangement and adding a layer of comfort underfoot.\n\nCultural origin: The Scandinavian style wall texture draws inspiration from Nordic design principles, which emphasize simplicity, functionality, and natural materials. This aesthetic is well-suited to the modern living room depicted in the image.\n\nPattern: The abstract pattern on the walls serves as a focal point, drawing the eye upwards and creating visual interest without overwhelming the space.
