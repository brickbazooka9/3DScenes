"prompt": "The image showcases a modern living room with a Japanese influence. The room features a minimalist design with clean lines and a neutral color palette, primarily in shades of gray, black, and white. The floor is laid with a dark wood plank, adding warmth to the space.\n\nThe walls are adorned with black and gold wallpaper, creating an elegant backdrop for the room's furnishings. A prominent design element is a series of large windows dressed in sheer curtains, allowing natural light to flood into the room.\n\nFurniture includes a sleek black sofa paired with two white armchairs arranged in a conversational grouping. A wooden coffee table sits atop the rugged floor, and a gold pendant light hangs from the ceiling, casting a soft glow across the space.\n\nThe overall visual aesthetic of the room is contemporary with an oriental twist, characterized by its simplicity and attention to detail. The cultural origin can be inferred as Japanese due to the harmonious blend of natural materials, geometric patterns, and a focus on functionality within the living space.",
