"prompt": " The image displays a room with a striking purple floral wallpaper on the upper section of one wall. This pattern is bold, featuring large flowers that are rendered in varying shades of purple and green, creating a vibrant visual effect. The lower portion of the same wall transitions to an orange geometric pattern that resembles a textured surface.\n\nThe room has a contemporary feel with a white sofa adorned with two orange throw pillows. To the left, there's a side table with a single vase containing flowers. The floor is covered by a patterned rug, and to the right, a section of the wall displays an abstract design in shades of pink and purple.\n\nThe visual aesthetic of the room leans towards modern with traditional floral patterns, which suggests a fusion of styles, possibly indicative of Indian decor motifs that are often seen in Indian interior design. The color palette is dominated by warm tones, with the use of purple as an accent color adding a touch of elegance and sophistication to the room. ",
