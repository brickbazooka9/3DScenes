"prompt": " The image showcases a modern and minimalist wall texture that embodies the Scandinavian style, characterized by geometric shapes and a monochromatic color scheme. The texture is composed of large white triangles against a neutral background. Each triangle has its own unique size and shape, creating an abstract pattern across the entire image. This type of design is often associated with modernist art and architecture, reflecting a preference for clean lines, simplicity, and functionality that are central to Scandinavian aesthetics. The use of white against a gray background gives the texture a sense of depth and contrast, while also maintaining a harmonious and balanced appearance. ",
