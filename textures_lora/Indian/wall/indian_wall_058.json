"prompt": " This image presents a stylized wall texture with a geometric design reminiscent of traditional Indian motifs. The material appears to be a digital or painted representation, giving the impression of a textured wall surface that could be used in interior decoration.\n\nThe pattern is composed of intersecting lines and shapes that create a symmetrical grid, providing a structured yet organic feel to the design. The color palette is minimalistic, primarily consisting of white as the base, with gold accents adding a touch of luxury and cultural richness. These accents are scattered across the design, highlighting the geometric patterns without overwhelming the overall aesthetic.\n\nThe visual aesthetic is one of modern artistry blended with traditional Indian culture, showcasing how contemporary design can incorporate elements of historical styles. The simplicity of white and gold suggests a clean, elegant approach to interior design, while the complexity of the intersecting lines and shapes adds depth and interest to the texture. ",
