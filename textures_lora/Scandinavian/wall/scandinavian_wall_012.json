The walls are adorned with artwork and framed designs that add an artistic touch to the space. A wooden coffee table with a black top serves as the centerpiece in the foreground.\n\nThe floor is covered with light-colored hardwood that complements the neutral tones of the room's color scheme, which includes beiges, whites, and a touch of brown from the furniture. The room has a Scandinavian style aesthetic, characterized by simplicity, functionality, and natural materials.\n\nThe textures are smooth with no visible roughness or graininess, suggesting that the walls might have a matte finish or a wallpaper application. There is an emphasis on clean lines and sharp angles, which creates a sense of order and tranquility. The overall visual aesthetic is one of modern elegance and understated sophistication.",
