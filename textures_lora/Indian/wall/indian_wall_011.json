"prompt": " This image depicts an interior living room scene with decorative elements that suggest an Indian cultural influence. At the heart of this aesthetic is a textured wall adorned with what appears to be traditional Indian designs, possibly influenced by mandala patterns or other folk art motifs. The texture seems to have intricate details and a glossy finish, typical of certain traditional Indian art forms.\n\nThe room itself is furnished with contemporary pieces, including a white couch with blue and red accent pillows that add pops of color against the neutral palette of the sofa. A large coffee table sits in front of the couch, providing additional seating or surface area. On one wall, a painting or artwork hangs, further enhancing the room's decorative theme.\n\nThe overall visual aesthetic is modern and sophisticated with cultural elements incorporated into the design. The room's layout appears to be open plan, with natural light streaming in from unseen windows. The flooring isn't fully visible, but it seems to complement the room's color scheme and style. There are no texts visible in the image. ",
