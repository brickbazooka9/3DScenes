"prompt": "This image features a room with a minimalist Scandinavian design, emphasizing simplicity and functionality. The walls are adorned with wooden paneling that adds a natural warmth to the space. A gray floor serves as a neutral base for the decor. The wooden ceiling beams add rustic charm and depth to the room. The furniture, including a bed, nightstand, and chair, is made of light-toned wood, enhancing the room's cohesive look.\n\nThe image itself displays two different textures side by side, both featuring a grayish tone with wood grain patterns. The left texture is denser and more pronounced, offering a richer and slightly darker wood appearance compared to its counterpart on the right. This suggests that the texture on the left might represent a heavier application of the same material as the one shown on the right.\n\nThe overall aesthetic is modern yet inviting, with an emphasis on natural materials and a neutral color palette. The use of wood in this room highlights the current trend in interior design toward using natural wood textures for both visual appeal and an eco-friendly approach to decoration.",
