"prompt": "The image depicts an interior space with a wall that features an intricate pattern with shades of blue, purple, and white. The pattern is dense and resembles traditional Indian textile designs, suggesting a cultural influence from the Indian subcontinent. The texture appears to be a wallpaper or a paint job designed to mimic wallpapering, given the three-dimensional effect and the way it fills in every space.\n\nIn front of this wall, there is a comfortable living area furnished with two couches covered in fabric with a hint of blue, which complements the wall design. The overall visual aesthetic of the image combines elements of interior decoration with cultural inspiration.",
