"prompt": " This is an image of a spacious living room with modern furniture and design elements. The visual aesthetic is sleek, clean, and contemporary. The floor texture appears to be inspired by the 'Indian style' but has been rendered in a manner that suggests a smooth, polished surface rather than a rough or natural feel typically associated with Indian textures.\n\nThe flooring material is not explicitly shown, but it gives off a veneer-like appearance, which could indicate a laminate or engineered wood floor with a glossy finish, designed to look like wood. The pattern on the floor consists of straight planks laid in a horizontal direction, which adds to the simplicity and elegance of the room.\n\nThe cultural origin label 'Indian style floor texture' might imply a connection to Indian designs or aesthetics, but the actual texture is abstracted to the point that it could be any smooth wood-like material, without direct reference to an Indian specific design. The visual aesthetic is one of modern luxury, blending minimalist furniture with clean lines and a polished floor. ",
