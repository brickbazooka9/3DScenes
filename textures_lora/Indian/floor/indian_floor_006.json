The pattern on the floor is a geometric mosaic, with different shades of cream and brown creating intricate designs. The wall is painted white, contrasting with the dark woodwork at the base. The ceiling features recessed lighting, and there's an ornate chandelier hanging from it. To the right, there's a bench covered in red fabric. At the end of the corridor, there's a room with a dining table and chairs visible through the open doorway. The overall visual aesthetic is richly textured and patterned, with an emphasis on symmetry and balance.",
