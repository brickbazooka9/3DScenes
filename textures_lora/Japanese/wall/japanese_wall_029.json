"prompt": " In this image, you are invited into a serene Japanese style room that exudes tranquility and Zen minimalism. The walls, painted in a soothing shade of light blue, are adorned with traditional Japanese sliding doors known as 'fusuma'. These doors, crafted from wood, are intricately designed with a black lattice pattern on the panels, allowing for light to filter through while maintaining privacy.\n\nThe room is punctuated by white partitions that stand tall, their height accentuating the spaciousness of the room. The floor beneath is covered in a light beige tatami mat, a staple in traditional Japanese homes, symbolizing simplicity and harmony.\n\nThe ceiling, featuring exposed wooden beams, adds a rustic charm to the otherwise modern design. The natural light streaming through the windows on the left side of the room creates a warm glow that illuminates the space, enhancing the sense of calm and peacefulness that this Japanese style wall texture aims to evoke.
