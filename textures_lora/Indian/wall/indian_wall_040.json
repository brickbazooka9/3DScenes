"prompt": "The image shows an interior space featuring a bed against a wall adorned with a textured, Indian-style pattern that has a golden hue with brown undertones, giving it an opulent look. The texture appears to be a stylized representation of marble or stone, which is commonly associated with high-end design and could be an imitation material for decorative purposes.\n\nThe bed has a simple, modern design with a white headboard and matching frame in what seems to be a light-colored wood or metal. On the bed, there are pillows with a pattern that complements the wall texture, suggesting a coordinated interior design theme.\n\nTo the left of the bed, a small nightstand holds a lamp with a traditional, possibly Art Deco style, which contrasts with the contemporary look of the bed. A picture frame is also visible on top of the nightstand. The flooring appears to be hardwood, adding warmth and a natural element to the space.\n\nThe curtains are patterned in a dark blue color that provides a subtle background for the room's decor. They are not fully visible, but they appear to match the overall color scheme of the room.\n\nOn the floor, there is a small area rug with a geometric design in shades of blue and gray, which enhances the room's visual interest without overpowering the space.\n\nThe window above the bed has white curtains partially drawn to let in natural light, contributing to the brightness of the room. The overall visual aesthetic of the image is one of elegance and sophistication with a touch of modern simplicity.",
