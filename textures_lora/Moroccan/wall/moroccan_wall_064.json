It features a repeating pattern of geometric shapes, including diamond and hexagonal motifs, with intricate blue and white glaze patterns. The tiles have a textured surface resembling worn stone or concrete, with varying shades of blue and white giving depth to the design.\n\nThe overall aesthetic is rich in cultural significance, suggesting an architectural element found in Moroccan riads or mosques, known for their elaborate tilework.
