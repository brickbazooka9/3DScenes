"prompt": "The image presents two photographs of a neatly arranged bedroom with a modern Scandinavian design aesthetic. In the left photograph, the room is slightly dimmer and features a plush bed with a yellow throw pillow, adorned with a black and white geometric patterned blanket. A large bookshelf stands on one side, housing an array of books, and a framed artwork above it. The wall texture appears to be a minimalist design, possibly a smooth stucco or a matte finish that complements the overall Scandinavian style of the room.\n\nIn contrast, the right photograph shows the same room with the same bedding but in brighter lighting. Here, the room is more vibrant and energetic. The yellow throw pillow has been replaced by a green one, maintaining its geometric pattern. A wooden side table is now visible on the left side of the bed, holding what seems to be a lamp with a classic design.\n\nThe overall visual aesthetic of the image is clean, organized, and functional, reflecting a contemporary Scandinavian interior design approach. The use of neutral colors such as white, gray, and brown creates a calming atmosphere, while the pops of color in the throw pillows add a touch of personality to the space. The room's decorative elements, including the bookshelf, artwork, and lamp, contribute to a well-curated living environment that balances simplicity with style.",
