There are two white couches facing each other, adorned with decorative orange pillows. A glass-top coffee table sits in front of one couch, complemented by a few round wicker tables and matching wicker poufs. Above the coffee table hangs a large, intricate pattern that resembles an abstract floral design, which adds a cultural touch to the space. The walls are painted white, creating a clean backdrop for the vibrant furniture. A small balcony or terrace is visible through a glass door, offering a glimpse of outdoor spaces. The overall aesthetic is one of comfort and modern style with a nod to Indian traditional patterns. ",
