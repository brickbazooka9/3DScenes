"prompt": "The image features an interior space that exudes a modern yet traditional Arabic or Moroccan aesthetic. Dominating the scene is a large, white archway that stands as the focal point of the room. This archway is embellished with intricate geometric patterns in hues of blue and brown, giving it a rich and luxurious feel. \n\nOn either side of this arch, there are two smaller arches, each adorned with similar decorative elements. The walls surrounding these arches are white, punctuated by large cut-outs that add a sense of openness to the space. \n\nTo the right of the archway, a room is visible with a plush blue sofa and a small coffee table. A few decorative items, such as vases and books, are arranged on the table, suggesting a cozy reading or relaxation area. \n\nThe overall visual aesthetic is one of elegance and luxury, with an emphasis on geometric shapes and clean lines that are characteristic of Moroccan architecture. The choice of blue for accents adds a refreshing pop of color to the otherwise neutral palette. This space could be in a luxurious villa or a high-end Moroccan-inspired hotel room.",
