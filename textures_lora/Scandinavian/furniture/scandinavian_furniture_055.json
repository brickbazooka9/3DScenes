"prompt": "This image depicts an interior living room scene characterized by modern Scandinavian design elements. The dominant color palette consists of neutral tones, with the walls painted in a light gray shade and the ceiling painted white. On the floor is a large area rug featuring a blue and white geometric pattern, which adds a touch of color to the otherwise monochrome room.\n\nThe furniture includes a gray sofa adorned with two throw pillows, one in a soft blue tone and the other in a lighter shade, complementing the rug's color scheme. To the left of the image, there is a dark wood dining table with three chairs around it. Above this dining area hangs a modern light fixture with a spherical shape that diffuses the light evenly across the space.\n\nThe kitchen features white cabinetry and white countertops, which are in contrast to the dark blue backsplash above the counter. This backsplash adds an accent color to the room without overwhelming the space. On the right, there is a dark wood sideboard with two doors, one of which has a decorative glass panel.\n\nThe flooring is made of large white tiles that give a clean and spacious feel to the area. A wooden coffee table sits in the center of the room, upon which rests a single blue cushion. The walls are decorated with simple framed artwork or photos, adding personal touches without cluttering the space.\n\nThe overall visual aesthetic is one of simplicity, functionality, and modern elegance, typical of Scandinavian interior design. **one**",
