"prompt": "This is an image of a textured surface that resembles wooden planks. The texture appears to be a flat lay, with the wooden planks arranged in a linear pattern. The color palette includes light gray and black, with the wood grain pattern visible throughout.\n\nThe material has a matte finish and displays a natural, earthy tone, which is common for wooden textures. The cultural origin of this texture could be traced to Scandinavian interior design styles, known for their simplicity, functionality, and natural aesthetics. \n\nThe pattern consists of straight lines that follow the length of each plank, creating a uniform, horizontal arrangement across the image. The overall visual aesthetic is minimalistic, with an emphasis on clean lines and natural materials, which contributes to a sense of calm and simplicity.\n\n**one**: \"Generate a Scandinavian style floor texture.\"",
