"prompt": " This is an image featuring a room with a predominantly white and pristine appearance. The floor texture appears to be a marble or polished stone, characterized by its reflective surface that highlights the play of light and shadows. The pattern is uniform and smooth, suggesting a high-quality finish.\n\nThe visual aesthetic is one of elegance and simplicity, with the minimalistic decor contributing to the spacious and airy feel of the room. There are no texts or distinctive branding present in this image.\n\nIn terms of cultural origin, the term 'Indian style' suggests that this style could be inspired by or associated with design styles from India, but without specific context, it is not possible to determine if the floor texture is indeed of Indian origin or merely influenced by it. The term 'style' here implies a design inspiration rather than an ethnic representation. ",
