"prompt": "The image depicts a room with a distinctly Moroccan-style wall texture, which features a geometric pattern reminiscent of traditional Moroccan zellige tiles. The pattern is characterized by alternating blue and white diamond shapes, creating a rhythmic visual effect. The overall aesthetic of the space includes a potted plant on a small table, with the top edge of the frame just below it, suggesting a modern, possibly bohemian interior design style. To the left, there's a glimpse of a patterned rug, contributing to the eclectic and decorative feel of the room.",
