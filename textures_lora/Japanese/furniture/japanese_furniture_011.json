"prompt": "The image is a collage of two distinct scenes. On the left, there's an interior scene featuring Japanese-style furniture. The wooden floor is adorned with intricate patterns in a traditional design reminiscent of Kyoto-style architecture. The walls are painted in a minimalist palette, while a sliding glass door allows natural light to flood into the room. A low wooden table and two chairs sit in front of it.\n\nOn the right, the same aesthetic is captured in an outdoor setting. The same patterned floor extends outside, leading up to a set of large, translucent glass panels that are likely Japanese-style screens. These panels are designed with geometric patterns and create a modern yet culturally rooted look. A small bench rests against these panels, inviting relaxation under the dappled shade.\n\nThe overall visual aesthetic is characterized by a harmonious blend of traditional Japanese design elements with contemporary western influences. The material textures include the smooth finish of the wooden furniture and flooring, as well as the glass panels' reflective quality.",
