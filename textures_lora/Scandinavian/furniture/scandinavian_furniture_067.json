"prompt": " The image showcases a room that exudes the Scandinavian style, characterized by clean lines, minimalism, and a light and airy aesthetic. The color palette is soft with neutral tones that create a calm atmosphere. \n\nThe furniture features simple geometric shapes, such as straight lines and rectangles, which are typical of Scandinavian design. There's a large sectional sofa upholstered in a light fabric, flanked by two sleek side tables with circular bases. A low-lying white coffee table sits in the center of the room, accompanied by a couple of chairs. \n\nIn one corner, there's a small desk with a chair, suggesting a workspace within the living area. The floor is adorned with a patterned rug that adds texture to the otherwise minimalist space. \n\nThe room is well-lit, either by natural light coming in from unseen windows or by the soft glow of indoor lighting. This creates a warm and inviting environment that is both stylish and functional. ",
