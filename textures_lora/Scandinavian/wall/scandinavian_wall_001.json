"prompt": "This is an image of a modern interior space. The walls feature a textured material that resembles a light beige or cream color, giving it a subtle and contemporary look. The texture could possibly be a type of plaster or stucco application, which is common in Scandinavian style design due to its ability to create an illusion of depth and character while maintaining a clean and minimalist aesthetic.\n\nThe room itself has a neutral color palette with light grays and whites dominating the space, accented by earthy tones found in the rugs and decorative elements. A large piece of wall art or sculpture is prominently displayed above the white sectional sofa, contributing to the room's contemporary art collection.\n\nThe overall visual aesthetic of the image is sleek and modern with a touch of cozy comfort. The design incorporates clean lines, minimal decorative elements, and a sense of openness due to the large windows or glass partitions that allow natural light to flood into the space.\n\nThis interior design style is popular in Scandinavian countries for its focus on functionality, simplicity, and the use of natural materials. It's particularly well-suited for spaces like this living room where the goal is to create a warm yet inviting atmosphere without overwhelming the eye with too much clutter or visual noise.",
