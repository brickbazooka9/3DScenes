"prompt": "The image shows an interior space that is styled in a modern, minimalistic manner reminiscent of Scandinavian design principles. The wall texture visible appears to be a matte finish with a subtle pattern that could be related to a natural, possibly textured material like paint or wallpaper. The room has a warm and inviting feel, with a monochromatic color scheme primarily featuring neutral tones accented by green plants adding a touch of nature.\n\nThe living area is furnished with two white sofas upholstered in what looks like a soft fabric, arranged around a low-lying coffee table that holds a few items including books and a decorative bowl. The coffee table also has a small round wooden side table with a single candle on it. Above the seating area hangs a chandelier with a dark finish, which contrasts with the light colors of the room.\n\nOn the right wall, there is a piece of art or artwork hanging, but the details are not clear enough to describe it. The flooring is partially visible and appears to be a wood-effect laminate or vinyl. The overall visual aesthetic is characterized by clean lines, a focus on simple forms, and the use of natural materials in a contemporary setting.\n\n**Scandinavian style wall texture**",
