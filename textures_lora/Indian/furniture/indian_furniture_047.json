"prompt": "The image shows a modern living room interior design. Central to the scene is a large sectional sofa, upholstered in a light gray fabric with a subtle texture that adds a contemporary touch to the space. The sofa's geometric patterns contrast nicely with the gray rug that lies on top of the wooden floor.\n\nThe walls of the living room are painted in a light beige color, providing a neutral backdrop for the furniture. To the left, there is a large, natural-stone wall that adds an earthy feel to the space. On the right side, the wall features a stone texture that complements the sofa and rug, tying the room's design together.\n\nBehind the sofa, there is a built-in cabinet with wooden shelves, giving the room storage while also maintaining its clean lines. Adjacent to the cabinet, on the left side, stands a large window with wooden blinds, allowing natural light to fill the space and highlight the room's textures.\n\nIn the foreground, there is a small round coffee table with a few decorative items on it. The overall visual aesthetic of this living room is modern, with a focus on natural materials and neutral colors that create a warm and inviting atmosphere.",
