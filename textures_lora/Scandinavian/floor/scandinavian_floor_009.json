"prompt": "The image depicts an interior space that exudes a modern Scandinavian aesthetic, characterized by minimalist design elements and a monochromatic color palette. The floor is covered in large square tiles, which are part of the overall design theme. The cultural origin of this style can be traced to Northern Europe, with its emphasis on simplicity, functionality, and the use of natural light. The pattern of the tiles appears to be uniform and flat, indicative of the Scandinavian preference for geometric shapes and clean lines.\n\nThe room itself features a herringbone wooden floor that transitions into the kitchen area, where a large island with bar stools is situated. Above this kitchen island, black metal frames create an open shelving unit, enhancing the sense of space and connection to the dining area beyond. The furniture and decor reflect contemporary design, with a focus on clean lines, neutral colors, and a mix of metallic accents that add depth and contrast to the room.\n\nThe ceiling is fitted with exposed ductwork, contributing to the industrial feel of the space. Potted plants and hanging light fixtures introduce natural elements into the design, creating a harmonious blend of modernity and organic texture. The overall visual aesthetic of the room is one of sophisticated minimalism, where each element serves a purpose while also contributing to the stylish ambiance.",
