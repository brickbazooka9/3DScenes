"prompt": "This image displays a textile with a geometric pattern that has a modern, possibly Scandinavian design aesthetic. The background features a dark color, which appears to be blue or black, serving as the canvas for the pattern. Overlaying this dark background are shapes that form what looks like a stylized tessellation, composed of various interconnected elements. These elements include abstract motifs resembling a combination of puzzle pieces, chains, and possibly glass shards or crystalline structures. The color palette consists of a mix of green, yellow, white, and blue hues that create a monochromatic effect.\n\nThe pattern is regular and repetitive across the fabric, suggesting a possible use for wallpaper, upholstery, or other decorative purposes. The design has a contemporary feel, with a play on colors, shapes, and the interlocking of elements to form a cohesive whole. The material of the fabric itself is not clearly distinguishable from the image, but it contributes to the overall texture and visual interest of the design.",
