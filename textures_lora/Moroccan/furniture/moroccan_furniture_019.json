"prompt": " The image depicts an interior setting featuring Moroccan style furniture texture. In the center, there is a bed with a richly patterned comforter that has a mix of colors including red, orange, blue, and green. This intricate blanket appears to be designed in the traditional Moroccan style, often associated with Berber or Rifien rugs known for their geometric patterns and vibrant hues. The bed is framed by two nightstands, each adorned with a lamp and a small decorative item on top.\n\nThe room itself has a cozy atmosphere enhanced by the warm tones of the furniture and bedding. Behind the bed, there's an ornate mirror reflecting the room's dÃ©cor. To the right of the bed, there is a window with drapes partially drawn, allowing for soft natural light to filter into the space. The curtains are not fully visible due to their position in front of the window.\n\nThe overall aesthetic of the image suggests a blend of traditional Moroccan elements with contemporary interior design. The use of rich colors and patterns creates a warm and inviting atmosphere, while the well-kept space gives a sense of order and cleanliness. ",
