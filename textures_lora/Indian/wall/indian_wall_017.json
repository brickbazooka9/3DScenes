"prompt": "The image displays an interior space with a distinct Indian-style wall texture. This pattern appears to be inspired by traditional Indian designs, possibly representing geometric shapes or symbols that are commonly seen in Indian art and architecture. The wall texture is applied to the upper half of the walls, creating a focal point and adding a cultural touch to the space.\n\nThe room itself has a modern aesthetic with gray upholstered sofas adorned with patterned cushions in shades of green and beige. A large, abstract artwork hangs above the sofa, featuring muted tones that complement the overall color scheme. The flooring is not fully visible but seems to have a light wood finish.\n\nThe furniture arrangement includes two sofas facing each other, with a coffee table in the center. On top of the table, there's a small plant and what appears to be a decorative piece or perhaps a remote control for the television, which is not fully visible but suggests an entertainment area. The room has a cozy yet stylish vibe, blending modern furniture with traditional wall art.\n\nThe overall visual aesthetic of the room is one of contemporary comfort with a nod to Indian design elements. It creates a space that feels both inviting and sophisticated.",
