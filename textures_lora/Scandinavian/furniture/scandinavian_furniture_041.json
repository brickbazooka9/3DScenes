"prompt": "The image presents a modern living room that exudes a Scandinavian style aesthetic, characterized by clean lines, minimalism, and natural light. The furniture texture is visible in the smooth surfaces of the contemporary pieces, such as the plush sofa and the sleek sideboard. Natural materials like wood and stone are used throughout, contributing to the warm yet uncluttered atmosphere of the space.\n\nThe room features a fireplace with a modern design, enhancing the cozy ambiance. Above it, a large window allows ample natural light to illuminate the interior, creating a bright and airy environment. A wooden floor runs throughout the room, complementing the furniture texture. The walls are painted in a neutral color, providing a blank canvas that does not compete with the furniture for attention.\n\nA key element of this aesthetic is the use of simple patterns, like the geometric shapes seen on the throw pillows and the rug, which add visual interest without overwhelming the room. This overall visual aesthetic promotes comfort and functionality while maintaining a stylish and inviting appearance.\n\n**One** concise line suitable as a Stable Diffusion prompt: \"Create an image of a Scandinavian style living room with a focus on natural light, minimalist furniture texture, and cozy modern design elements.\"",
