"prompt": " This image depicts a pair of flat wooden planks with a distinctive corrugated, undulating pattern across their surfaces. The planks exhibit a rich, warm wood grain texture that suggests they are made from light-colored wood. The overall visual aesthetic is clean and minimalist, evoking a sense of modern design. The Scandinavian style wall texture label implies that the design may have cultural roots in Scandinavian interior design, known for its simplicity and functional elegance. The pattern created by the corrugations adds an interesting contrast to the flat planks, enhancing their visual appeal and potentially serving as a decorative element in an interior space or as an accent piece in exterior construction.
