"prompt": " This is an image of a floor with a texture that resembles Scandinavian style flooring, characterized by its light color and what appears to be a wooden plank pattern. The material seems to be a laminate or vinyl product, mimicking the look of natural wood in a stylized manner. The pattern consists of horizontal planks with variations in tone that create an illusion of depth and authenticity, typical of high-quality imitation hardwood.\n\nThe visual aesthetic is clean, modern, and minimalist, which is often associated with Scandinavian design principles. This type of floor texture is commonly used in contemporary homes and offices due to its versatility, ease of installation, and affordability compared to real wood floors. ",
