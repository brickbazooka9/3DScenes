"prompt": " This image depicts a cozy room with a distinctive Indian style wall texture that features a tree and birds motif, which adds a vibrant splash of color against the neutral backdrop. The tree, adorned with birds in flight, appears to be a stylized representation commonly associated with peacocks, a bird often considered auspicious in Indian culture.\n\nThe wall texture itself has a textured appearance, suggesting it could be made from plaster or a similar material that gives depth and visual interest to the space. The colorful decoration on the wall is likely intended to bring a touch of nature indoors, which is consistent with elements often found in traditional Indian interiors.\n\nThe room has a comfortable and inviting atmosphere. There's a red bench at the foot of a bed with brown headboards, and a small wooden nightstand is visible next to the bed. The bedding has a warm tone that complements the overall color scheme of the room.\n\nPlease note that this description is based on the visual elements present in the image and does not include any text or additional contextual details.
