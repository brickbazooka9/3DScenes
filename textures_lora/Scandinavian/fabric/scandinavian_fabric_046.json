"prompt": " This image features a piece of fabric that exhibits a unique texture and pattern, reminiscent of Scandinavian design aesthetics. The fabric has a black background with white geometric patterns that are arranged in a symmetrical grid-like structure. These patterns resemble diamond shapes, creating an optical illusion effect when viewed from certain angles.\n\nThe style of the patterns is clean and modern, with straight lines and precise geometric forms. The overall appearance of the fabric is crisp and minimalistic, suggesting a contemporary design sensibility. The use of high-contrast colors contributes to the striking visual impact of the fabric's texture. ",
