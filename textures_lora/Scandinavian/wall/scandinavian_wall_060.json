"prompt": "This image depicts an interior living room setting. The room has a clean, contemporary design with a white color scheme. The walls feature a textured pattern that resembles wood or a wooden-themed material. The cultural origin of this texture appears to be inspired by Scandinavian style, often characterized by natural tones and simple geometric designs, which is evident in the patterns on the wall.\n\nThe overall visual aesthetic of the room is minimalist and modern, with a focus on simplicity and functionality. The furniture includes a couch with two accent chairs, both adorned with colorful cushions that add a pop of color to the otherwise monochromatic space. A bookshelf filled with various items provides additional decoration. Above the couch hang three framed images, possibly artwork or photographs, adding a personal touch to the room.\n\nThe floor appears to be made of wood, maintaining the natural and warm atmosphere that complements the texture on the wall. The lighting in the room is soft and diffused, creating a comfortable ambiance.",
