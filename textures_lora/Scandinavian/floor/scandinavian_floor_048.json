The floor has a distinctive pattern resembling interlocking tiles or planks, suggesting a texture that adds depth to the space. This style is typically associated with minimalism and an emphasis on natural materials, often seen in Northern European homes. The color palette is neutral with warm whites, light browns, and subtle greys creating a serene atmosphere.\n\nThe kitchen is well-lit, with natural light coming from a large window that offers a view of lush greenery outside, connecting the indoor space with the outdoor environment. The room features an island in the center, providing additional counter space for food preparation or casual dining. Above it hang pendant lights with a modern design, adding a touch of contemporary style to the space.\n\nThe furniture and decorations are kept simple yet functional, with wooden chairs around the island and a clean, uncluttered look. Plants bring a sense of freshness into the room, while the use of wood in the furniture complements the overall design theme. The overall visual aesthetic is clean, modern, and inviting, showcasing a style that is both stylish and functional.",
