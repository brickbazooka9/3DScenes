"prompt": "The image depicts an abstract geometric tessellation that resembles traditional Japanese mats or 'futon.' It features a series of rectangular panels arranged in a grid-like pattern, with each panel having a simple, unadorned design. The colors are neutral, consisting mainly of beige and cream shades, which gives it a natural, earthy feel. The tessellation itself has a rhythmic quality to it due to the repetition of shapes and sizes. This is a representation of the Japanese 'kumi' aesthetic, which values order, balance, and harmony. The pattern is both simple and intricate, providing a visual feast for the eyes while maintaining a sense of tranquility and minimalism.",
