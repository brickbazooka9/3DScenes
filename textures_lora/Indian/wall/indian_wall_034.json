"prompt": "The image presents a modern living room setting featuring an Indian-style wall texture. This texture has a rich, warm tone, predominantly in shades of brown and beige, with darker accents that add depth and contrast. The pattern is reminiscent of traditional Indian art, where intricate designs are created through the use of natural materials like earth, water, air, and fire to represent nature's elements.\n\nThe overall aesthetic of the image is modern, yet it incorporates elements that harken back to traditional Indian culture. The wall texture serves as a focal point, drawing the eye with its dynamic pattern. In the foreground, there's a sleek, contemporary coffee table with a textured surface and what appears to be a plant on top. Above it, hanging from the ceiling, are several modern pendant lights in varying sizes, providing both illumination and decorative interest.\n\nTo the right of the table, there is a single gray armchair, which contrasts with the warm tones of the wall texture. The chair's neutral color complements the vibrancy of the wall while still maintaining a modern feel. A small plant rests on the armchair, adding a touch of greenery to the space.\n\nThe flooring is not clearly visible in the image, but it seems to be a neutral-toned surface that doesn't compete for attention with the other elements in the room. The overall ambiance of the space is serene and inviting, blending contemporary design with traditional Indian influences.",
