"prompt": "The image presents an interior space that exudes a Moroccan style, characterized by its use of blue and white fabrics, which are rich in pattern and color. The material is textured, creating a sense of depth and dimension. These fabrics adorn the wall behind a pink sofa, which adds a pop of color to the scene. Above the sofa, three ornate lamps hang from the ceiling, their blue shades complementing the fabric on the wall. To the right of the sofa, there is a potted plant with green foliage. The overall visual aesthetic is warm and inviting, with an emphasis on symmetry and balance.",
