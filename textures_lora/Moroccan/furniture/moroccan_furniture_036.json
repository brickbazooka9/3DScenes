Dominating the scene is a traditional Moroccan room, characterized by its intricate plasterwork, known as stucco marrakech (tadelakt). The walls are painted in a deep, rich red color, with the ceiling featuring similar plasterwork, adding a sense of grandeur to the space.\n\nThe furniture is an eclectic mix of Moroccan and Indian styles, which is evident in the choice of materials like woven wicker for seating and traditional metalwork for tables and shelves. The upholstery showcases vibrant patterns in shades of blue, green, and red, reflecting the rich cultural heritage of both countries.\n\nThe room is well-lit with natural light streaming through a window on the right side, casting soft shadows that highlight the textures of the furniture and walls. The floor is adorned with a geometric pattern, further enhancing the visual aesthetic of the space. ",
