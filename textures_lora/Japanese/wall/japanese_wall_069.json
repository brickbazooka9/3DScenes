"prompt": "The image presents a unique texture that is reminiscent of Japanese style wall textures. It features a wooden structure, possibly an exterior wall of a building or a standalone feature, with several wooden panels arranged in a vertical alignment. Each panel has a smooth, light brown finish, and they are interspersed with horizontal slats. These slats create a geometric pattern that adds depth to the texture.\n\nIn the middle of the structure, there is a black and white signboard with Japanese text on it. The text is not fully visible, but from what can be discerned, the word \"galaxy\" is included. This suggests that the structure may have a commercial or cultural purpose, perhaps related to a business called Galaxy.\n\nThe overall aesthetic of the image is simple yet intriguing due to the contrast between the natural tones of the wood and the stark black and white signboard. The vertical alignment of the panels gives the structure a sense of height, while the horizontal slats add a sense of rhythm and order to the design. The Japanese text on the signboard introduces an element of cultural identity, hinting at a story or context behind this unique texture wall.",
