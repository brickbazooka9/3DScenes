The tiles themselves are square with a central hexagonal motif featuring a stylized flower or sunburst, surrounded by intersecting lines that create a repeating pattern across the surface.\n\nThe floor's design elements include elaborate floral patterns and decorative geometric shapes, all rendered in shades of blue on a white background. The craftsmanship suggests an artistic touch with attention to detail, giving the impression of being hand-laid.\n\nThe overall visual aesthetic is one of cultural richness, artistic elegance, and traditional craftsmanship, evoking a sense of history and place. This texture could be used for wallpaper, flooring, or as a backdrop for architectural designs inspired by Moroccan architecture.",
