"prompt": "The image showcases a cozy living room that embodies Scandinavian design principles. Dominating the left side of the frame is a large, comfortable blue couch, its plush cushions inviting relaxation. Adjacent to it on the right, a vibrant teal armchair adds a pop of color to the space. Both pieces of furniture are crafted from wood, their natural tones harmonizing with the room's decor. \n\nIn front of the couch, a small wooden table holds court, upon which rests a single book, perhaps waiting to be picked up for a quiet evening read. Above this seating arrangement, a fireplace is embedded in the wall, serving as a warm focal point and a hint at cozy winter evenings spent indoors.\n\nThe walls of the room are not left bare but instead serve as a canvas for an eclectic collection of books, their spines displaying a variety of colors and sizes that speak to the interests of those who live here. \n\nOn the right side of the image, two wooden chairs add to the room's seating options. They are arranged neatly, suggesting that this is a space where conversation and connection are valued.\n\nThe floor beneath is adorned with an area rug in a neutral tone, providing a soft carpet for bare feet or adding warmth underfoot. The overall visual aesthetic of the room is one of simplicity and functionality, combined with thoughtful decorative accents that create a welcoming and comfortable atmosphere.",
