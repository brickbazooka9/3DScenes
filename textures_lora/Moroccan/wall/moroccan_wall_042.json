Dominating the back wall is a large, ornate mosaic patterned in intricate shapes and colors, predominantly featuring shades of blue, green, and gold on a dark background. This elaborate mosaic is characteristic of traditional Moroccan tilework, known for its attention to detail and geometric designs.\n\nThe living room itself is luxuriously appointed with plush seating upholstered in a creamy beige fabric. A low wooden coffee table sits in the center of the seating arrangement, offering a warm contrast to the cool color palette of the wall mosaic. On the left side of the image, a wooden cabinet can be seen, adorned with decorative items that add to the room's refined ambiance.\n\nThe floor is covered by a patterned area rug with a subtle geometric design that complements the back wall mosaic. The overall visual aesthetic is one of grandeur and meticulous craftsmanship, reminiscent of traditional Moroccan interiors found in palaces or upscale riads.",
