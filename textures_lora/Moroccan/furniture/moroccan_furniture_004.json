"prompt": "The image features an interior wall decorated with a large, intricate blue geometric pattern that mimics the appearance of a traditional Moroccan tiled wall. This design is characterized by concentric circles and interlocking geometric shapes, reminiscent of the zellige tiles often used in Moroccan architecture. The colors are predominantly shades of blue on a lighter background, with subtle variations in tone that add depth to the pattern.\n\nThe furniture in the image has a contemporary design with clean lines and minimal ornamentation, which contrasts sharply with the vibrant and busy nature of the wall decor. The sofa is upholstered with a light-colored fabric, and there's a hint of a white rug on the floor, both of which are simple in comparison to the bold wall treatment.\n\nThe visual aesthetic of the image is one of modern luxury, fusing traditional Moroccan design elements with contemporary furniture pieces to create a space that is both stylish and culturally rich. The overall effect is one of warmth and sophistication, evoking a sense of tranquility and exotic elegance. **Moroccan-inspired interior decor with vibrant geometric wall texture.",
