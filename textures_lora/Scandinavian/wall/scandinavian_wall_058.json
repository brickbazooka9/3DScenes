The walls are adorned with a textured wallpaper featuring a subtle, gradient pattern, reminiscent of the minimalist aesthetic found in Scandinavian interior design. The color palette is soft and soothing, dominated by neutral tones that complement the wooden flooring and furniture.\n\nOn one side of the room, there's a comfortable sofa covered with cozy cushions. A wooden coffee table sits in front of it, hosting a few decorative items. To the right, a wall-mounted shelving unit holds an array of books and decorative objects, adding to the homely atmosphere.\n\nThe room is well-lit, thanks to the large window that offers a view of a serene garden. The floor beneath is made of warm wooden planks, adding a touch of rustic charm to the space. Above the sofa, a framed picture hangs on the wall, contributing to the room's personalized touch.\n\nOn the left side of the room, a desk area is set up with a white chair in front of it. The desk has a few items scattered across its surface, including a plant that brings a bit of nature indoors.
