The wall texture exhibits a monochromatic palette of gray tones, giving it a modern and sophisticated look. The pattern on the wall has a subtle, irregular grid-like design that adds depth and visual interest to the space.\n\nIn front of the textured wall, there is a contemporary living room setup. To the left, there's a long, light-colored bench with decorative cushions. Above this seating area, two vertical wooden panels add a natural touch to the room. On the right, there's a sofa adorned with colorful throw pillows, which creates a warm and inviting atmosphere.\n\nThe floor is covered in a light-colored wood that complements the neutral tones of the wall texture. The overall aesthetic of the space suggests a blend of modern design with Indian textile inspiration, reflecting elements of traditional craftsmanship within a contemporary setting. The use of geometric shapes and patterns in the wall texture and the decorative elements on the sofa contribute to the visual aesthetic of the room. ",
