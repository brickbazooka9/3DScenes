"prompt": "The image presents two distinct views of a modern, well-decorated living room that exhibits a Scandinavian design aesthetic. The left side of the image shows a cozy and inviting seating arrangement with a light wood sofa paired with a gray armchair. On top of the sofa is a collection of framed photographs, adding a personal touch to the space. Above the sofa hangs a large, abstract painting that draws the eye upwards, contributing to an open and airy feel.\n\nThe right side of the image provides another perspective, highlighting the same couch but this time with a different arrangement of decorative items on top. The photos are now clustered around a central point, creating a focal area of interest that changes the overall look of the space without altering the core design elements.\n\nBoth perspectives feature a wooden coffee table in the center, providing a contrasting surface to the soft upholstery on the sofa. The room is adorned with various items including a potted plant on the floor, a lamp perched on top of the couch, and a vase with flowers adding a pop of color and life to the space.\n\nAround the walls, the room is decorated with wall art that includes abstract paintings and framed photographs, further enhancing the Scandinavian style of the room. The light wood flooring complements the furniture pieces, maintaining a consistent material theme throughout.\n\nThe color palette is neutral, dominated by whites, grays, and browns, with accents of green from the plant and flowers, and pops of red and blue from the cushions on the sofa. The overall visual aesthetic is modern and minimalist, with an emphasis on clean lines and natural light.",
