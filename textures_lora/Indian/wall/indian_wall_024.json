"prompt": "The image depicts a modern living room space featuring a vivid green textured wall that exhibits a marble-like pattern, suggesting a possible Indian origin design influence. The material used for the wall texture appears to be an acrylic or a similar synthetic product, rather than natural marble. Cultural origination of such textures could be inspired by traditional Indian aesthetics while adapting to contemporary interior decoration trends.\n\nThe pattern is composed of varying shades of green that create depth and intrigue. The texture looks smooth but contains subtle variations in tone and intensity, giving it a marbled effect. This pattern provides a bold visual focal point for the room.\n\nOn the wall, there are two modern decorative elements: a yellow pendant light with a geometric design and an abstract painting with a blend of greens and browns, complementing the wall texture. The seating area includes a low-profile gray sofa with a cushion, positioned centrally in front of the wall. To the left of the couch, there is a small side table with a plant on it, contributing to a serene atmosphere.\n\nThe overall visual aesthetic of the room can be described as contemporary with an Indian influence, showcasing a fusion of modern design and cultural patterns.",
