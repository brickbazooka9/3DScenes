"prompt": "The image displays a close-up of a textured wall surface, which appears to be made of light-colored wood planks arranged in a horizontal pattern. This texture has a smooth and slightly shiny quality, with the individual wood planks exhibiting variations in grain and reflectivity, adding depth to the material's appearance. The cultural origin of this texture is Scandinavian, as evidenced by its simplicity and clean lines, which are characteristic design elements associated with Scandinavian-style interiors.\n\nThe pattern across the wood planks is linear, following the horizontal alignment of the boards themselves, creating a sense of order and tranquility. The overall visual aesthetic of the image is minimalist and warm, evoking a sense of coziness and natural charm.",
