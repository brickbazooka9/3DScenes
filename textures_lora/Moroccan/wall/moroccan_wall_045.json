"prompt": " The image presents a vibrant display of Moroccan style wall textures, composed of multiple patterns that come together to create a colorful and intricate design. \n\nThe texture is characterized by a variety of shapes and colors, each contributing to the overall aesthetic. It's a collage of small squares, arranged in a grid-like pattern that gives the impression of a mosaic. The individual squares are filled with geometric patterns in a palette of bright red, sunny yellow, lively green, and cool blue, all rendered in a pixelated style reminiscent of retro computer graphics. \n\nThe color scheme is eclectic, with no dominant color, instead each square holds its own unique color profile. The overall visual aesthetic is one of diversity and vibrancy, reflecting the rich cultural heritage of Moroccan design. ",
