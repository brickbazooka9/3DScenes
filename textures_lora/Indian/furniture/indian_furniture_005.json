"prompt": "The image presents an interior space that exudes an Indian-inspired design theme, characterized by a combination of rich colors and intricate patterns. Dominating the visual scene are walls painted in a vibrant turquoise hue with accents of teal and blue. These walls feature elaborate ornate designs in varying shades of the same color palette, creating a cohesive visual effect that is both striking and harmonious. \n\nThe ceiling is architecturally unique, with wooden beams painted white, providing a contrast to the darker tones of the wall decorations. The flooring is not visible in the image.\n\nA defining feature of this room is the large arched doorway that frames the view into an adjoining space, adding depth and perspective to the scene. The doorway is flanked by two mirrors that reflect and distort the room's layout, creating a sense of symmetry and balance.\n\nIn the center of the image, there is a small table or stand with a plant perched on top. This touch of greenery adds a natural element to the otherwise man-made surroundings. The overall aesthetic of the space suggests a fusion of traditional Indian architectural elements with modern interior design principles.",
