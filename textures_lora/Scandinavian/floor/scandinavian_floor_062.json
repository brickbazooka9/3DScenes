"prompt": " This image depicts a modern kitchen with a Scandinavian design influence. The kitchen features a clean, minimalist aesthetic with light wood cabinets that have a warm, natural tone. The countertops are made of marble, which has a veiny pattern and a cool, gray color that complements the warm tones of the cabinets.\n\nIn the center of the room is a wooden dining table with a single green chair placed in front of it, suggesting a dining or kitchen island arrangement. The floor texture appears to be a polished concrete or wood, adding to the industrial feel of the space. \n\nThe walls are painted white and adorned with several framed items, including what seem to be photographs and a piece of wall art, contributing to the room's decorative elements. There is no visible text on the image. The lighting in the kitchen is bright and evenly distributed, highlighting the clean lines and smooth surfaces of the furniture and fixtures. ",
