The wall texture has a geometric pattern, reminiscent of traditional Japanese artistry, characterized by its intricate and interlocking designs. This texture is applied to the background, giving the impression that the entire space is unified in this aesthetic.\n\nThe room itself features a modern and minimalist design. On the left side, there's a sofa with a plush blue upholstery, providing a contrast against the green wall texture. Adjacent to the sofa, there's a potted plant adding a touch of nature to the space. On the right side of the image, there is a piece of artwork hanging on the wall, contributing to the contemporary feel of the room.\n\nThe color palette is soft and neutral, with the green wall texture as the dominant hue, complementing the cool blue tones found in the upholstery of the sofa and other elements. The overall visual aesthetic is one of modern simplicity, blended with a subtle nod to traditional Japanese design through the use of wall texture. ",
