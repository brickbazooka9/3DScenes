"prompt": " A Japanese style wall texture image features wooden slats arranged in horizontal rows against a vertical wood panel backdrop, creating an architectural aesthetic. This texture is richly detailed with natural wood grain variations and a rustic feel that evokes traditional Japanese craftsmanship. The pattern formed by the overlapping and aligned planks has a visually pleasing rhythm that may remind one of traditional Japanese screens or room dividers known as 'fusuma'. The overall visual aesthetic is warm, organic, and evocative of cultural heritage. ",
