"prompt": "The image depicts an interior living space that exudes a Scandinavian aesthetic, characterized by clean lines, neutral color palettes, and natural light. The wall texture appears to be a smooth, possibly faux finish, which is commonly associated with Nordic interiors as it lends itself to minimalistic design.\n\nThe room features a large window allowing ample daylight into the space, enhancing the airy feel of the decor. A white ball light hangs from the ceiling, providing additional illumination. The color scheme is dominated by neutral tones, with the beige walls serving as a blank canvas that complements the sparse but tasteful furnishings.\n\nThe furniture includes a gray sofa positioned in front of the window, accompanied by a wooden coffee table. Above the sofa, framed art adds an artistic touch to the room, contributing to its contemporary feel. A fluffy white rug lies on the floor, softening the acoustics of the space and adding warmth underfoot.\n\nA flat-screen TV is mounted on the wall opposite the window, offering entertainment options for those seated on the sofa. The overall visual aesthetic is one of simplicity and elegance, with an emphasis on functionality and a sense of tranquility.\n\n**One** concise line suitable as a Stable Diffusion prompt: \"Create a cozy Scandinavian living room scene.\"",
