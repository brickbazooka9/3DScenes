"prompt": "The image features two modern armchairs positioned side by side against a backdrop of a neutral-toned room with minimal decorative elements, predominantly focused on the chairs themselves. The chairs have a simple, geometric design with smooth lines and curves, exhibiting a contemporary Scandinavian aesthetic. They are upholstered in a textured fabric that gives a slight sense of depth due to its woven pattern. The chair on the left is complemented by a small, square side table with a natural wood finish, while the right chair has a similar style table in an unusual pastel pink color. The flooring appears to be light-colored wooden planks laid in a herringbone pattern, contributing to the overall warmth and simplicity of the room. There is no visible text or branding within the image.",
