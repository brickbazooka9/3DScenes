"prompt": " This is an image of a repeating pattern texture that appears to mimic a carpet or rug design in an Indian style. It features a series of interconnected geometric shapes, predominantly hexagons, arranged in a seamless layout that creates an intricate network across the image. The color palette consists mainly of shades of brown, suggesting a natural or earthy aesthetic, possibly intended to represent dirt or soil. The pattern has a hand-drawn quality, giving it a rustic and organic feel. The use of negative space within each hexagon adds depth and complexity to the design.

The visual aesthetic of this texture is richly detailed with a focus on pattern and symmetry. ",
