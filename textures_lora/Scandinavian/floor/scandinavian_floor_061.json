"prompt": "The image depicts a modern interior with a Scandinavian design aesthetic. The floor has a subtle, textured pattern that appears to be made of light-colored wood or laminate, giving the room a natural and warm atmosphere. The walls are painted in a dark green hue, providing a bold contrast to the lighter tones of the furnishings. The ceiling features an industrial look with exposed ductwork painted white, adding to the contemporary feel of the space.\n\nThe furniture includes a bed with white linens tucked into a dark wooden frame, and a large, L-shaped sofa in a neutral tone. A small round coffee table sits in front of the sofa, holding what seems to be a decorative centerpiece or book. To the right, there is a dining area with a sleek black table surrounded by four chairs; on top of the table, there's a laptop and a couple of candles. Above the bed, two circular light fixtures hang, offering additional ambient lighting.\n\nIn the background, a dark, built-in wardrobe can be seen to one side, contributing to the room's overall modern aesthetic. The walls are adorned with minimalist decor, including abstract art pieces and a couple of potted plants. A large round mirror is mounted on the wall above the bed, reflecting light and adding depth to the space.\n\nThe visual aesthetic of the room can be described as sleek, contemporary, and inviting. It seems to be designed with comfort and functionality in mind while also providing a visually appealing environment for relaxation and entertainment.",
