The coffee table holds a decorative tray with a candle on top, suggesting an inviting atmosphere for socializing or relaxation. \n\nOn the right wall, a large mirror reflects the room, enhancing its spaciousness and allowing one to appreciate the overall design aesthetic. Above this mirror, a series of alcoves is visible, each adorned with intricate tilework in hues of white, blue, and gold, contributing to the room's opulent feel. \n\nThe flooring is also decorated with a pattern that matches the rug, further unifying the design theme across the space.
