Dominating the scene is a room, characterized by its high ceiling and large windows that allow for ample natural light to illuminate the space. \n\nThe walls are adorned with intricate patterns in shades of blue and white, which are reminiscent of traditional Moroccan tilework known as 'zellij'. The floor is covered with a richly textured rug featuring hues of red, green, and beige, adding warmth to the room.\n\nA large wooden table takes center stage in the room, surrounded by several chairs that invite guests for conversation or a meal. Above the table hangs a chandelier, its presence subtly enhancing the ambiance of the room.\n\nThe cultural origin of this style is evident from the Moroccan lantern that casts a soft glow over the space. The room's visual aesthetic is one of opulence and comfort, with an emphasis on patterns, textures, and warm lighting. It creates an inviting atmosphere that evokes a sense of hospitality and cultural richness. \n\n**Short label**: \"Moroccan style fabric texture\"",
