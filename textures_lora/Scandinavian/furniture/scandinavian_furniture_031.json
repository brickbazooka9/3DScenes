"prompt": "The image captures a contemporary Scandinavian-style living room with a warm, welcoming ambiance. Dominating the space is a large gray sofa, which sits in front of a white wall adorned with modern art, including a vibrant abstract piece and a simple, elegant portrait. A wooden coffee table sits in front of the sofa, holding a small plant that adds a touch of nature to the room.\n\nTo the right of the sofa, there's a black sideboard with a sleek design, above which hangs a contemporary pendant light. The floor beneath is a light hardwood, complementing the overall color palette of the room. A white rug with geometric patterns in hues of blue and gray lies underfoot, adding texture to the wooden floor.\n\nOn the left side of the image, there's a large window covered by blinds, allowing for natural light to filter into the room. Adjacent to this window is a small, minimalist dining table accompanied by a single chair, suggesting a space that can be easily adapted for different functions.\n\nIn the background, a wooden bench with a red pillow on it offers additional seating. The walls are decorated with simple modern art pieces and a plant that adds a touch of greenery to the room. A painting in warm tones is mounted above the dining table, adding depth to the space.\n\nThe room is well-lit, thanks to the large window, and the furniture is arranged in a way that encourages conversation and interaction. The overall visual aesthetic of the image is one of clean lines, natural materials, and a harmonious blend of functionality and style. **Scandinavian style furniture texture**",
