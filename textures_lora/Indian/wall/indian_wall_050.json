"prompt": "The image depicts a spacious living room with an Indian-inspired theme, characterized by its warm earth tones and traditional patterns. The most striking feature is the vibrant peacock design on the walls, a motif commonly associated with Indian culture. This texture pattern includes geometric shapes and is predominantly red and gold, suggesting it might be inspired by the traditional peacock feather print, known as \"Amaravati\" in India.\n\nThe living room itself is furnished with a comfortable seating arrangement featuring a beige sofa adorned with colorful cushions. A wooden coffee table sits in front of the sofa, adding to the homey feel. Above the sofa, there's a modern chandelier with a geometric design that adds a touch of contemporary style to the room.\n\nThe floor is covered in a large, patterned area rug, mirroring the peacock motif on the walls. The rug's intricate design complements the overall aesthetic and ties the room together.\n\nOn the left side of the image, there's a vertical painting or sculpture of a woman, possibly a representation of the Hindu goddess Saraswati, known for her association with knowledge, music, and arts. The art piece adds an element of spirituality to the room.\n\nThe room has ample natural light, presumably from large windows not visible in this view, casting soft shadows on the white walls and highlighting the rich colors of the furniture and decor.\n\nA large window with wooden blinds allows for a glimpse of the outside world, while ceiling fans suggest an intentional desire to keep the room cool. The overall visual aesthetic is one of warmth, comfort, and traditional Indian style.",
