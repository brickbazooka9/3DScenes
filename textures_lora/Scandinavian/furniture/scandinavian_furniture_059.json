"prompt": "The image presents a spacious kitchen interior, characterized by a modern Scandinavian design aesthetic. Dominating the scene is a light wood floor that flows seamlessly into the built-in cabinetry lining the walls of the room. A central island with a countertop and stools serves as a focal point, suggesting a space for casual dining or socializing.\n\nThe kitchen features a large window allowing ample natural light to flood the room, accentuating the warm tones of the wood elements. The cabinetry is designed in a minimalist style with flat surfaces and simple hardware, contributing to the clean lines typical of Scandinavian design. A white range hood stands out against the otherwise monochromatic palette of light grays and whites.\n\nThe room is furnished with modern kitchen appliances such as a refrigerator, oven, and sink integrated into the cabinetry. The sink area has been accentuated with wooden cutting boards, enhancing the overall cohesion of the design.\n\nScattered throughout the space are decorative items like vases and cookbooks, adding personality and charm to the room without overwhelming it. A small dining table accompanied by chairs indicates a separate area for meals. The overall visual aesthetic is one of simplicity, functionality, and natural beauty, with a strong emphasis on clean lines and neutral colors.",
