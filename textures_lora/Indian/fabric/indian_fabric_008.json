"prompt": "The image displays a texture that resembles an Indian style fabric or wallpaper. It features an intricate, symmetrical floral and paisley pattern with a central hexagonal motif filled with floral designs in shades of pink, orange, and green. This central design is enclosed by a border composed of variously shaped leaves and flowers that exhibit a rich, dark brown on a lighter brown background. The overall visual aesthetic suggests a cultural influence from South Asian textiles known for their floral and paisley patterns, which often incorporate motifs inspired by nature or mythology. This texture would be suitable for a variety of applications such as wall decoration, tablecloths, or fabric design for clothing or home furnishings.",
