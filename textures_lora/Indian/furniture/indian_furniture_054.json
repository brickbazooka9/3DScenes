"prompt": " The image captures an Indian-style living room with tastefully arranged furniture. Dominating the center of the frame is a large, plush couch in a rich red or maroon color, adorned with beige and white patterned cushions. A dark wooden coffee table sits in front of the couch, providing a space for drinks or snacks. \n\nFlanking the couch are two wooden armchairs, each upholstered with a different fabric: one in a classic black leather and the other in a soft beige fabric. The chairs are positioned as if they frame the room's main seating area. \n\nA painting of Buddha hangs above the couch, adding an artistic touch to the space. Below it, a modern chandelier with warm, orange-yellow lights casts a cozy glow throughout the room. \n\nTo one side, a large window allows for natural light to enter during the day and offers a glimpse of the outdoors. On this wall, a small table lamp is turned on, contributing to the ambient lighting in the room. \n\nThe floor beneath these pieces is carpeted in a neutral tone, providing comfort underfoot. The walls surrounding the space are painted in a light beige color, allowing the vibrant furniture and decorations to stand out. The overall visual aesthetic of this living room is one of warmth, comfort, and cultural richness. ",
