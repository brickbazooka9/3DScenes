"prompt": "This image depicts an interior space designed in a modern Scandinavian style, characterized by clean lines, light colors, and minimalist decoration. The room features a large, floor-to-ceiling window that allows natural light to enter the space, illuminating the white walls and ceiling.\n\nThe furniture is sleek with a mix of materials: the seating area includes a leather ottoman and a black sofa with wooden legs, while the dining table has a simple, light wood finish. The chairs are upholstered in what appears to be velvet or a similar plush fabric. On the left side of the room, there is a patterned, floor-to-ceiling glass divider that adds a modern touch and helps define the living space from the dining area.\n\nThe cultural origin of this style can be traced back to the Scandinavian countries like Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, where simplicity and functionality are highly valued. The design of the room is minimalist with a focus on functionality and comfort.\n\nThe color palette is soft and neutral, with the exception of the black sofa, which introduces a bold accent color to the space. The overall visual aesthetic is one of modern elegance with a touch of warmth from the wooden elements and textured fabrics.\n\nIn summary, this texture image captures a well-lit, Scandinavian-style living room that exudes a sense of modern elegance with its minimalist design and thoughtful choice of materials and colors.",
