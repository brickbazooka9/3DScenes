"prompt": "This image depicts an interior living space that showcases a Scandinavian style, characterized by minimalism and simplicity. The room features a large gray sofa with wooden legs, positioned in the center of the frame. Adjacent to it is a gray armchair with a matching wooden leg. A round coffee table sits in front of both pieces of furniture, and on top of it, there are a few books and a small plant. Above the table hangs a light fixture with a spherical design and white lampshade.\n\nThe walls are painted in a light grey color, which complements the gray tones of the furniture. A large window allows natural light to fill the room, adding to the airy feel. To the right of the frame is a decorative element resembling an abstract tree, with its branches reaching towards the ceiling. The floor has a warm wooden finish that contrasts with the cool grey of the walls and furniture.\n\nThe cultural origin of this image can be traced back to Scandinavian interior design, known for its use of natural materials and neutral color palettes, which creates a calm and inviting atmosphere. The pattern in this room is quite sparse, adhering to the minimalistic theme.",
