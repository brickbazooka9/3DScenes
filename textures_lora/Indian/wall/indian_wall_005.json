These patterns are intricate, with geometric shapes and motifs that are commonly found in South Asian folk art.\n\nThe ceiling of the room is painted white but adorned with a large, chandelier-style light fixture, which casts a warm glow over the space. The floor beneath is tiled in a light color, providing a neutral backdrop for the vibrant wall decoration.\n\nIn the foreground, a portion of a couch and a table can be seen, suggesting a living or sitting area within the room. A potted plant with lush green leaves adds a touch of natural greenery to the room, placed near a window that is not visible in the image. The overall aesthetic of the room combines traditional Indian design elements with contemporary interior decor choices. ",
