"prompt": " This image showcases a room with Japanese style furniture texture, characterized by minimalist design principles and natural materials. The wall is adorned with artwork that adds a touch of color and artistic flair to the otherwise neutral palette of the space.\n\nThe flooring is a rich hardwood in a warm brown tone, contributing to the warmth of the room. The furniture pieces are made from wood, giving them a natural and organic feel. The sofa, a significant feature, has an earthy brown color with a sleek, modern design. A white cushion adds a pop of contrast, creating visual interest on the piece.\n\nIn the center of the room is a small coffee table crafted from light wood. It hosts a single object, a vase, that sits as a decorative accent. The overall aesthetic is one of tranquility and simplicity, reflecting the Japanese design philosophy of using unadorned natural materials in functional yet aesthetically pleasing ways. ",
