"prompt": " This image showcases a fabric with an intricate design, which is reminiscent of a Scandinavian style. The fabric has a rich, royal blue background adorned with a repeating pattern composed of white floral and leaf motifs that are interspersed with gold accents. The patterns are arranged in a diagonal arrangement, giving the fabric a dynamic feel. The overall texture appears to be soft and plush, indicative of high-quality fabric. The use of dark blue as the base color, along with the white and gold accents, creates a striking contrast that is visually appealing. The design elements suggest a connection to traditional Scandinavian patterns, which are often characterized by clean lines and organic shapes. ",
