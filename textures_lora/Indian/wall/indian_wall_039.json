"prompt": " The image displays two distinct sides of a room, showcasing the interior decor in different styles. On the left side, the wall features an \"Indian style wall texture,\" which appears to be a natural material with a rough, earthy finish, reminiscent of traditional Indian architecture. This texture covers only one wall and is located on the lower half of the image.\n\nOn the right side, a modern flat-screen TV is mounted on a sleek, minimalist wall. The TV is off, reflecting no light, which suggests it's in a room with low ambient light. Below the TV, there is a wooden console table holding a vase with flowers and what appears to be a decorative object or sculpture.\n\nThe style of the image is realistic, as indicated by the watermark 'Text-to-Image Model,' which suggests that this could be a digital rendering rather than an actual photograph. The aesthetic of the room combines traditional elements with contemporary design, creating a fusion of old and new styles.\n\nPlease note that this description is based on the visible content in the image and does not include any speculative or imaginary details.
