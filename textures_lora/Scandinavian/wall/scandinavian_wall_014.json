"prompt": "The image presents an interior room, dominated by a Scandinavian style aesthetic. At the heart of the scene is a kitchen, characterized by its wooden cabinetry in a natural wood finish that adds warmth and a touch of rustic charm to the space. White walls with a subtle texture create a neutral backdrop, allowing the wooden elements to stand out prominently.\n\nThe ceiling features a wooden beamed design, enhancing the room's cozy and inviting ambiance. A hanging light fixture casts a soft glow throughout the space, accentuating the textures of both the wood and the painted walls.\n\nA large window dressed with curtains lets in ample natural light, creating a bright and airy atmosphere that is further accentuated by the presence of several potted plants distributed around the room, adding a touch of greenery and life to the interior.\n\nThe floor is covered in wood planks, providing an uninterrupted flow from the kitchen into what appears to be a dining area. The furniture includes a wooden table surrounded by chairs with cushioned seats, inviting one to sit and enjoy a meal. \n\nThe walls are adorned with patterned tiles above the cabinets, adding a decorative element that complements the overall Scandinavian style of the room. A rug with a tribal pattern lies on the wooden floor, serving as an eye-catching focal point and a contrast to the predominantly natural tones of the room.\n\nThe color palette is predominantly neutral with shades of white, beige, and natural wood tones. The use of wood in various forms - furniture, flooring, and ceiling beams - creates a harmonious blend of materials, contributing to the room's rustic-meets-modern aesthetic.\n\nOverall, the visual aesthetic is one of simple elegance, with each element carefully chosen and placed to create a cohesive and inviting living space.",
