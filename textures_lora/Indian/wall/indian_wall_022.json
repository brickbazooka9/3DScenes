"prompt": "The image depicts an elegantly furnished room with a focus on the floor-to-ceiling window that showcases a large, ornate chandelier hanging from the ceiling above it. The window frame is inlaid wood with traditional Indian motifs and the glass panes are adorned with a delicate floral pattern, reminiscent of Mughal art. The curtains on either side of the window are also decorated with the same intricate design.\n\nThe room itself features light-colored walls that are embellished with a subtle, decorative texture resembling the traditional Indian pattern known as Paisley or Mehndi. This texture is characterized by its repetitive, elongated oval shapes in shades of white and gray against the wall backdrop, adding a touch of sophistication and cultural heritage to the space.\n\nThe furniture includes two upholstered sofas with contrasting red cushions, positioned facing each other to promote conversation. The coffee table between them is covered with a textured glass top that echoes the pattern on the walls. Above the sofa, there's a framed artwork with an abstract design and bold colors, contributing to the room's contemporary feel.\n\nThe floor is covered with large, light-colored tiles that complement the overall color scheme of the room. The rug in front of the sofas adds warmth and texture, while the hanging wall sconces provide additional lighting. There are no visible texts or brands in the image.",
