"prompt": "The image shows an interior space featuring a wooden structure that resembles a soundproofing panel or acoustic foam. The panels are arranged in a vertical, staggered pattern with a varying number of horizontal slats on each panel, giving the illusion of a rhythmic visual experience as if looking through a tunnel or into a perforated surface. This design element creates an interesting interplay of light and shadow, which is enhanced by the natural wood grain that varies in tone from dark to light brown. The cultural origin suggests a modern architectural approach often associated with Scandinavian design, characterized by minimalism, functionality, and the use of natural materials. The overall visual aesthetic is one of clean lines, organic shapes, and an emphasis on simplicity and elegance.",
